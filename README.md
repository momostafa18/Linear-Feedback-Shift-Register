# Linear-Feedback-Shift-Register
LFSR is a Linear Feedback Shift Register which is used to create random numbers but to a limit where it depends on the no of used bits then a sequence of numbers will begin 
it xors N-1 input together and the output is tied to the input then the input is shifted each time a new output is generated
The output tied to the MSB of the input to get the longest chain of random numbers 


## Usage
1. Open the simulation tool and load the project files.
2. Simulate the provided testbenches or create your own test scenarios.
3. Analyze the simulation results to observe the behavior of the UART transmitter and receiver.
4. Modify the design files to experiment with different configurations or features.
